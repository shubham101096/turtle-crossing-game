# turtle-crossing-game
In this game, player has to move the turtle upwards, saving it from the moving cars across the path. If the turtle collides with a car, game's over. When the turtle crosses the finish line, the level increases. The turtle starts agin from the starting position but the speed of cars increases, thus increasing the difficulty level.
